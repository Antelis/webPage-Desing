# Adding a Card

## Instructions

1. Under the jumbotron is a row with 2 nested columns set up for our card components.
<br>
Inside the first column, add a `<div>` and assign it a class of `"card"`. We’ll be making a garden related card for the webpage.

2. Use the [Bootstrap’s card documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.2/components/card/) to add a header.
<br>
The text in the header should read `Planting in the spring.`

3. Below the header add an image that renders at the top of the card.
<br>
Use the image **flowers.png** in images directory.
<br>
Also, remember to assign the appropriate class.

4. Time to add more text to this card: Under the image, add a `<div>` with a `class` of `"card-body"`.
<br>
Inside the `<div>` you just made, add `<p>` with a `class` of `"card-text"`. The text should read `It's almost spring time, get your seeds ready for planting!`

5. Great job adding a card to the page. Now, add your own customized card to the 2nd column!

If you want to add another image, feel free to use: **tropical.png** in images directory.
